# Real-Time Chat App

## Description
**Real-Time Chat App** is a real-time messaging application that enables instant communication between tabs or windows of the same browser using **Service Workers**. It allows users to send and receive messages instantly, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience.

## Features
- **Real-time messaging**: Messages are sent and received instantly between browser tabs.
- **User-friendly interface**: Simply type a message in the input field and click the "Send" button.
- **Responsive design**: The app adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal experience.
- **Multi-tab support**: Open the app in multiple tabs or windows to chat simultaneously.

## How to Use the App
1. Open the app in two or more windows/tabs of the same browser.
2. Type a message in the input field.
3. Click the "Send" button to send the message.
4. See the message appear instantly in other tabs.

## Running the Project with Offline Functionality

To experience the offline functionality of this project, it is necessary to run it on a local server, as **Service Workers** require an HTTPS environment or at least being served from a local server to function correctly. Additionally, **GitHub Pages** might not handle offline functionality properly, as it may redirect you to a "chrome-error" page in case of a network failure, preventing the Service Worker from operating and using the cached resources.

### Requirements:

1. **Live Server** (or any other server that serves content from an HTTP or HTTPS local environment).

### Steps to run the project with Live Server:

1. Install the **Live Server** extension in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.
4. The project will open in your browser, and you can test the offline functionality, such as caching resources and availability when there is no internet connection.

### Why is a local server required?

**Service Workers** require the project to be served from a server because they do not work correctly with local files (`file://`). Using Live Server or a local server resolves this issue, enabling proper offline functionality and the registration of the Service Worker.

**Note:** If the project is hosted on an online server (such as GitHub Pages), it may not handle offline functionality as expected. If you go offline while using the project, GitHub Pages might redirect you to a "chrome-error" page instead of allowing you to operate with cached resources. Therefore, for full offline functionality, it is recommended to use a local server environment.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to explore and implement **Service Workers**, providing a hands-on approach to understanding their functionality.

### Future Improvements
In the near future, the project aims to expand its capabilities to:
- Enable real-time communication across different devices.
- Eliminate browser dependency, making the app more versatile.

## Technologies Used
- **Service Workers**: To manage messaging between tabs.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For the app's structure, design, and logic.
- **Responsive Design**: For smooth adaptation to different devices.

**Note:** This project is a functional prototype designed to explore the potential of **Service Workers** and their integration into modern web applications.
